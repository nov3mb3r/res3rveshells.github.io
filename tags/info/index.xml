About me: I never liked exploits and injections. But my friends did. So they became hackers. Now I have no friends&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up performing necromancy on dead computers (the official term, you might have heard of is post-mortem forensics) and hunting cyber witches (i.e threat hunting). I seek redemption by catching the bad guys.</description></item></channel></rss>
