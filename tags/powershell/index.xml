The flags were mostly the output of a command relating to one of the following 8 challenges:
Encryption\Cipher Filesystem Registry Logs\ Tasks Enterprise Services DNS Data Manipulation Q\A Rules of engagement Download the PoSh Hunter VM and log in using the credentials provided Use the PoSh Hunter VM to answer the challenges (minus the Q/A general PowerShell knowledge questions) The point value for questions varies based on difficulty Disclaimer We don&amp;rsquo;t want to spoil the CTF since it is still active, so we decided to make a (non-exhaustive) list of commands that were used during the game, and will definitely be useful in your infosec career.</description></item></channel></rss>
